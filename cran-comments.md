We have been unable to submit new versions to CRAN Since v2.4.2, at which time CRAN started rejecting this package due to its dependency on the orpaned package 'bit'. We have now dropped the dependency (using the new Andromeda package).

Since v2.4.2 there have been 10 changes, 5 bugfixes (see NEWS.md).
